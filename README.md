## What is this?

A genetic algorithm to approximate a given image using circles.

Basically, the world's shittiest art plagiarist.

I made this in 2009 inspired by a [playful stack overflow post about doing
extreme image compression by approximating an image as polygons](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/891643/twitter-image-encoding-challenge). I can't find
the post but it was cool.

I rediscovered this in 2017 and I like it. I fixed a few bugs, made it output
SVG, and upgraded it from a random greedy search to what could be generously
called a genetic algorithm. I have much faster computers now than the eee PC I
originally wrote it on. It's also nice way to heat my apartment this winter.

## Why is it so shit?

Everyone's a critic.

## Why is it so shit at faces?

I like that it's bad. It's one of the more interesting qualities of the
generated images. A little spooky.

I think it's not so much that it's bad at faces (I mean, it's definitely partly
that), but that we're incredibly good at faces.  Maybe we're slightly hurt that
the computer thinks we look like a big blob.

My cat thinks I look like a tuna dispenser, so w/e.

This is what my cat looks like
